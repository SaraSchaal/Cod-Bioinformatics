### Information about my samples
#### Sample collection
I sequenced a total of 300 Atlantic cod samples. Within these 300 samples, I had 160 samples that came from populations around Iceland and 140 samples from the Gulf of Maine:

Iceland Samples:  
40 	Pop 1  Southwest Offshore  
40 	Pop 2  Southwest Nearshore 
40	Pop 3  Northeast Offshore  
40 	Pop 4  Northeast Nearshore  

Gulf of Maine Samples:  
35	Pop 5  Massachusetts Bay Red Cod 
18 	Pop 6  Massachusetts Bay (putatively) Olive Spring Cod 
37  Pop 7  Massachusetts Bay Olive Winter Cod  
25  Pop 8  Cashes Ledge Red Cod  
25 	Pop 9  Cashes Ledge Olive Cod  

The goal of our study is to identify whether red and olive cod represent a similar ecotype that has been described in other populations including Iceland, frontal (offshore migratory cod) and coastal (nearshore stationary cod). We aimed to evaluate the genomic basis for differentiation within these two populations. 

#### Sample prep

https://www.omegabiotek.com/product/e-z-96-tissue-dna-kit/
Fin clips from samples were extracted using E.Z. 96 Tissue DNA Kits (SKU: D1196-01). 

https://www.covaris.com/me220-focused-ultrasonicator-500506
Extracted samples were mechanically sheared using a Covaris ME220 sonicator to 300 bp.

Libraries of each sample were made using half reactions of the KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Material Number: 7962363001). We used custom primers with unique indexes on both the i5 and i7 primers and custom adaptors with unique barcodes in order to multiplex all 300 samples.

Librarys were quantified on an AriaMx Realtime qPCR machine using KAPA Library Quantification Kit - Illumina (Cat: KK4824). Using the qPCR quantifications, samples were combined for sequencing in equimolar ratios.

We sequenced the final pool of samples using paired end 2x150 bp sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq S4 flow cell to an average coverage of 15x.
